/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership security model for the
 * DataConnect Nigeria application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is centered around the principle that users have complete
 * control over their own data, and no access to anyone else's. All data is
 * considered private to the user who created it.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All application data is stored under the top-level `/users` collection.
 * Each user's data is contained within a single document whose ID is the
 * user's Firebase Authentication UID (e.g., `/users/{userId}`). This structure
 * creates a clean, scalable, and secure data boundary for each user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Enumeration is Disabled: Users are explicitly forbidden from listing
 *   the documents in the `/users` collection. This is a critical security measure
 *   to prevent malicious actors from harvesting a list of all application users.
 *   A user is only permitted to perform a query that specifically targets their
 *   own user document.
 * - Strict Ownership: All read and write operations are gated by an ownership
 *   check, ensuring a user can only ever interact with their own document.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, the rules enforce that the `id` field
 *   inside a user's document must match the document ID (their auth UID). This
 *   field is then enforced as immutable on all subsequent updates, guaranteeing
 *   a permanent and trustworthy link between the document and its owner.
 * - Prototyping Flexibility: In line with a rapid development approach, these
 *   rules do not validate the specific shape or data types of user-provided
 *   content (like `name` or `phoneNumber`). The focus is strictly on robust
 *   authorization.
